Design and implement a CLI-based Student Management System in Python using OOP principles. The
system should manage student records, course enrollments, and grade assignments, with the added
capability to save and load data to/from a file.
Instructions
Section A: Class Design and Implementation
1. Class 1: Person
○ Attributes:
■ name (str): Name of the person.
■ age (int): Age of the person.
■ address (str): Address of the person.
○ Method:
■ display_person_info(): Print the details of the person (name, age, and address).
2. Class 2: Student (inherits from Person)
○ Additional Attributes:
■ student_id (str): Unique identifier for each student.
■ grades (dict): Dictionary containing subjects and their respective grades (e.g.,
{"Math": "A", "Science": "B"}).
■ courses (list): List of courses the student is enrolled in.
○ Methods:
■ add_grade(subject, grade): Add or update the grade for a specified subject.
■ enroll_course(course): Enroll the student in a specified course.
■ display_student_info(): Print all details of the student, including enrolled courses
and grades.
3. Class 3: Course
○ Attributes:
■ course_name (str): Name of the course.
■ course_code (str): Unique course code.
■ instructor (str): Name of the instructor.
■ students (list): List to store students enrolled in this course.
○ Methods:
■ add_student(student): Add a student to the course.
■ display_course_info(): Display the course details and the list of enrolled students.
Section B: System Functionalities
Develop a menu-driven CLI for users to interact with the system. Below is a description of the main
options and functionalities.
1. Add Student
○ Prompt the user for the following details: name, age, address, and student_id.
○ Create a new Student object with these details and add it to the system.
2. Enroll in Course
○ Prompt the user for the student_id and course_code.
○ Enroll the student with the specified ID in the course with the specified code.
3. Add Grade
○ Prompt the user for student_id, course_code, and grade.
○ Assign or update the grade for the student in the specified course. Ensure the student is
enrolled in the course before assigning a grade.
4. Display Student Details
○ Prompt the user for the student_id.
○ Retrieve and display the student’s details, including enrolled courses and grades.
5. Display Course Details
○ Prompt the user for the course_code.
○ Retrieve and display the course’s details, including the list of enrolled students.
Section C: Error Handling and File Operations
1. Error Handling
○ Verify that student_id and course_code exist before processing any operations.
○ Ensure grades are only assigned to students for courses in which they are enrolled.
2. Bonus Challenge: Save and Load Data
○ Implement two functions to manage file operations:
■ save_data(): Save all student and course data to a file in JSON format.
■ load_data(): Load data from the file, restoring student, course, and enrollment
information when the program restarts.
