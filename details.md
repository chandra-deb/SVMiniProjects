(Project 1) : Simple Calculator
OVERVIEW:
In this assignment, you will develop a basic calculator program using Python. This project
will reinforce fundamental programming concepts including functions, user input,
conditional statements, and error handling. The application will run in the terminal and
should not use any external libraries or frameworks.
TASKS:

1. Function Definitions: Implement functions for the following operations: addition,
   subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Each function should take two
   arguments, perform the corresponding operation, and return the result.
2. Implement User Input Handling: Prompt the user to select an operation( e.g. 1
   for Add, 2 for Subtract, 3 for Multiply, 4 for Divide and 5 for Modulus) and input two
   numbers. Convert these inputs into appropriate data types for calculations.
3. Conditional Logic: Use ‘if’, ‘elif’, and ‘else’ statements to determine which
   arithmetic operation to perform based on user selection.
4. Output Formatting: Display the results in a clear and readable format. Examples:
   Addition: 5 + 6 = 11
   Division: 5 / 2 = 2.50
5. Error Handling: Include checks to handle division by zero and other potential
   errors. Provide informative error messages to guide the user.
   SAMPLE INPUT OUTPUT:
   Select operation:
6. Add
7. Subtract
8. Multiply
9. Divide
10. Modulus
    Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
    Enter first number: 5
    Enter second number: 8
    5.0 + 8.0 = 13.0
